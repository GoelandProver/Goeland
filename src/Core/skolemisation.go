/** This file provides multiple ways to skolemize a formula.
 *
 * Currently implemented techniques:
 *
 *   - outer skolemization. Default technique: fresh symbol parameterized by
 *     all the metavariables of the branch.
 *
 *   - inner skolemization. Somewhat optimized technique: fresh symbol
 *     parameterized by the metavariables appearing _inside_ the formula to
 *     skolemize. Activated with the -inner option.
 *
 *   - pre-inner skolemization. This is the same mechanism as inner
 *     skolemization, except that we reuse the skolem symbol when skolemizing
 *     multiple times formulas in the same alpha-equivalence class. Activated
 *     using the -preinner option.
 *
 * We provide a generic [Skolemization] interface, which implements a single
 * function [skolemize] parameterized by (i) the formula to skolemize ∃x.δ(x),
 * (ii) the formula δ(x) where x should be replaced, (iii) the variable x itself
 * and (iv) the list of metavariables present inside a branch.
 *
 * If you wish to implement a new skolemization technique, you should follow
 * these steps:
 *
 *   1. Add a brief description of the technique in the list above.
 *   2. Create a file in the [Sko] folder with a structure that implements
 *      the [Skolemization] interface.
 *   3. Add a variable in this file refering to this structure.
 *   4. Add an option that updates the [selectedSkolemization] variable (via
 *      the function [SetSelectedSkolemization]).
