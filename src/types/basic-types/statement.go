/*
A function to get a FormulaRole from a String
  - "axiom"s are accepted, without proof. There is no guarantee that the axioms of a problem are consistent.
  - "hypothesis"s are assumed to be true for a particular problem, and are used like "axiom"s.
  - "definition"s are intended to define symbols. They are either universally quantified equations, or universally quantified equivalences with an atomic lefthand side. They can be treated like "axiom"s.
  - "assumption"s can be used like axioms, but must be discharged before a derivation is complete.
  - "lemma"s and "theorem"s have been proven from the "axiom"s. They can be used like "axiom"s in problems, and a problem containing a non-redundant
  - "lemma" or theorem" is ill-formed. They can also appear in derivations.
  - "theorem"s are more important than "lemma"s from the user perspective.
  - "conjecture"s are to be proven from the "axiom"(-like) formulae. A problem is solved only when all "conjecture"s are proven.
  - "negated_conjecture"s are formed from negation of a "conjecture" (usually in a FOF to CNF conversion).
  - "plain"s have no specified user semantics.
  - "fi_domain", "fi_functors", and "fi_predicates" are used to record the domain, interpretation of functors, and interpretation of predicates, for a finite interpretation.
  - "type" defines the type globally for one symbol; treat as $true.
  - "unknown"s have unknown role, and this is an error situation.
